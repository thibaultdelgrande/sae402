# 2D Smoothed Liquid Simulation in WebGL

TODO: this README is still under construction!

This project is an implementation of 2D liquid simulation using  Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics in WebGL.
You can see some simulations made using this implementation below

[You can see the full simulations in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHvIOMl7-pQ).
You can export the JSON files into the corresponding demo to run the simulations yourself. **But note that these simulations were renderered offline**, and they will probably not run in real-time for you. Note that the implementation is not very efficient, and using too many particles(about more than 1500) will slow down the GUI and the entire simualation.

## Brief Technical Details

The water simulation is based on the paper [Particle-based Viscoelastic Fluid Simulation](http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/Clavet-2005-PVFS/pvfs.pdf), which is a variaton of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. But not all details of the paper are implemented. The implemented parts are Double Density Relaxation(section 4), and Viscosity Impulses(section 5.3).

The collisions between the water and the rest of the environment is rest not handled by the water simulation. The environment is all represented by capsulses. This simplifies the code much, because it is trivial to check for collision with a capsule. To handle the collision, we use the formulas derived in [section 4.4.2.2 of"Lagrangian Fluid Dynamics Using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics"](http://image.diku.dk/projects/media/kelager.06.pdf#page=33).

## How to Record Offline Simulations

The below instructions are what works for me. But I have only tested this on my Mac, so this may or may not work for you. If you can't get it to work no matter what, make I pull request and I will help you.

If you press the record button, you will start recording the simulation. This functionality uses the FileSystems API, **so it will only work on Chrome!** 

Once you press record, the program will start saving the frames of the simulation to some place on your filesystem. On my Mac, this location is `/Users/eric/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/File System`. On windows, this location appears to be `C:\Users\Eric\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\File System`. At this location, there are folders named `001`, `002`, and so on. In one of these folders(probably the most newly created one) the recorded frames can be found.
In that folder, enter the folder `p/`. In this folder, the recorded frames are saved in the TGA format, and they are spread out over directories named `00`, `01`, and so on. You will need to gather the frames of these folders into a single folder. 

I provide the script [gather.py](scripts/gather.py) for gathering up all the files in one folder. Set the variables `in_path` and `out_path` to specify the output and input folders, run the script, and if it works, it will copy all the frames to a single folder. In the process, it will convert the `.tga` files to `.png` files using `imagemagick/graphicsmagick`, because this makes it much faster to later convert the frames to a video.

If you have `ffmpeg` installed, you can now easily make a video. Go to `out_path` and run the command

```Bash
ffmpeg -framerate 50 -i frame%08d.png -c:v libx264 -r 50 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4
```

and it will create a video in `out.mp4`. If you want a GIF, you can make it using imagemagick by doing

`convert -delay 2 -loop 0 frame*.png out.gif`

or by using graphicsmagick

`gm convert -delay 2 -loop 0 frame*.png out.gif`

but we aware that this will take quite a while!

If want to record another simulation after recording a first one, **be sure the clear the cache before you do so!** To do this, go to [chrome://settings/cookies](chrome://settings/cookies) and delete the site data for the demo. If you do not do this, the numbering of the frames of the new simulation will not start from zero, and  `gather.py` will not handle this special case for you.


## Build

To run the demo locally on your computer, first change your directory to the directory of the project, then run

```bash
npm install
```

To then run the demo, do

```bash
npm start
```
